# Act of Random Kindness
A very simple Android app that sents a random message of kindness to a random contact!

This application was built for an assignment for the [User Interface and Mobile Application](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~joanne/cs250) class 
by Dr. Joanne Selinski at JHU in Spring 2014, with collaboration from assignment partner Matthijs Taselaar.
Joanne actually used my app as an example in this course in 2015 and 2016 :bowtie:

### Features Overview
* Generate a random text message from a preloaded collection of messages of kindness.
* Randomly select a recipient from your contacts
* Or, manually choose a recipient of your choice
* Optionally choose to send a picture (camera or choose from photo gallery) with the message
* Send the message as an SMS or MMS
